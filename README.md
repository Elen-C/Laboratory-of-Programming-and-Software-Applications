### Exercise 1:
A program reads a three-digit integer from the keyboard and displays it in reverse order. Use only very basic commands (no control structures).

### Exercise 2.1:
An electricity company charges electricity consumption as follows: 
- A fixed amount of 5 euros per month.
- For the first 500 kWh, the charge is 0.5 euros/kWh.
- For the next 400 kWh, the charge per kWh is increased by 8% (compared to the previous charge rate).
- For the next 200 kWh, the charge per kWh is increased by 12% (compared to the previous charge rate).
- Finally, for each subsequent kWh (up to 4000, which is the maximum permitted consumption), the charge per kWh is increased by 20% compared to the previous charge rate.

Write a program in which, after entering an integer from the keyboard that corresponds to the monthly consumption in kWh, the program calculates and displays on the computer screen the total amount charged for the account. 

__Hint__: Assume that the total monthly consumption cannot exceed 4000kWh. In case the user enters an invalid value for the number of kWh, the program terminates by displaying an appropriate message on the computer screen.

### Exercise 2.2:
Write a program in which the user enters real values ​​corresponding to the coefficients α, b, c of the quadratic equation y = ax^2 + bx + c through the keyboard. Then, after checking that the value of α is different from 0, the program calculates the vertex and the axis of symmetry of the parabola described by the previous equation.

### Exercise 3:
For loops.

### Exercise 4: 
Write a program that sorts the elements of an array in ascending order (bubble algorithm).
